        <h3>Racism</h3>
        <p>Homophobia is the dislike of or predjudice against homosexuals. It can leave many LGB teens feeling isolated, <br>
          lonely and ashamed. The irrational fear of homosexuals creates an environment where such individuals face <br>
          harrassment in the forms of mostly verbal, physical, and mental abuse. This abuse is present in schools, communities,<br>
          and homes across the globe.All of this negativity adds on to the self-doubt that causes LGB teens to turn to drugs <br> 
          and/or alcohol to numb their feelings. A lack of tolerance for homosexuals also affects straight people <br>
          (heterosexuals).Homophobia can ruin familial relationships. Some family members break off their relationships with <br>
          LGB relatives.</p>
          
       <h3>Bullying</h3>
       <p>Bullying is when someone harrassess someone else. This can be mental, physical, social, emotional, and/or cyber bullying. <br>
          To prevent bullying you stop it before it starts. If you experince harrasment on a regular basis, tell a teacher, a parent, <br>
          or guardian. This harrassment could be directed towards you or someone else. Helping yourself or someone else is not being a tattle tale. <br>
          If you see it, report it. It's all about commonuncation. </p> 
       <p>Victims of bullying can show certain signs. Such signs are known as symptoms. This includes unexplained injuries, <br>
          a change in eating habits, or being less sociable than before. Not all victims of bullying show these signs. <br>
          This is when you have to pay attention. If you think someone is a victim of bullying, ask them about it. Sometimes <br>
          it is easier for the victim to be approached by someone who is willing to help rather than appraoching someone on <br>
          their own. Bullies mainly try to humiliate their victims and make them devastated. This can lead to the victim <br>
          feeling responsible for the bully, and they will begin to believe that the harrassment is their fault, and there <br>
          fore should not talk to anyone about what is going on. Whenever you see a student or peer in danger, make sure you <br>
          take it seriously.</p>
