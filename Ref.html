        <h2>Five Kinds of Hate</h2>
       <h3>Anxiety</h3>
           Someone suffering from anxiety is likely to exhibit behavioral examples of:
           <ul>
               <li>is unusually quiet</li>
               <li>become more withdrawn if encouraged to talk</li>
               <li>to ask questions or initiate conversations</li>
               <li>fears being embarrassed or humiliated</li>
               <li>do poorly in school</li>
               <li>avoids classmates outside class</li>
               <li>sits alone in the library or cafeteria</li>
               <li>may refuses to go to school or drop out</li>
           </ul>
          <p>Suicide can be a result of a lot of <br>
          things like traumatic incidents, mental disorders, depression, lack of emotional support, failure<br>
          social isolation. Social anxiety can cause social isolation. Social anxiety that is not caused by <br>
          a traumatic incident or other environmental factor can not be prevented. This kind has been mentally<br>
          delevoped over time on its own terms, and can not be prevented, but there are treatments such as<br>
          medicine, but some patients misuse it. If you suffer from social anxiety, face your fears at your <br>
          own pace. Doing this could really be better for you in the long run, because it helps you get more <br>
          comfortable in social situations by coping with your condition. </p>

          and solutions if you need it. </p>
       
       <h3>Sexism</h3>
           <p>Both genders can suffer from sexism, but women are more often victims to sexist comments or behavior. <br>
           Women go through cat-calling and offending comments. Most women respond with ample attitude towards <br>
           the source of the verbal comments. This response has recieved one in return; that some women are responsible <br>
           for their own sexual abuse. In the same essence, one of the main reason people are against feminism is that <br>
           they think feminists are too quick to react negatively to events that imply a woman was taken advantage of.</p>
           <p>The solution to sexism starts with <b>us</b>. Feminism works toward eradicating the oppression of females and the <br>
           pressure on males to act a certain way. Promoting this movement would help solve the overlying problem <br>
           of sexism. </p>
 
       <h3>Homophobia</h3>
        <p>Homophobia is the dislike of, or predjudice against homosexuals. It can leave many LGBT teens feeling isolated, <br>
          lonely and ashamed. The irrational fear of homosexuals creates an environment where such individuals face <br>
          harrassment in the forms of mostly verbal, physical, and mental abuse. This abuse is present in schools, communities,<br>
          and homes across the globe. All of this negativity adds on to the self-doubt that causes LGBT teens to turn to drugs <br> 
          and/or alcohol to numb their feelings. A lack of tolerance for homosexuals also affects straight people <br>
          (heterosexuals).Homophobia can ruin familial relationships. Some family members break off their relationships with <br>
          LGBT relatives.</p>
          <p>Possible solutions for homophobia are centered around therapy. A mentally medical professional would be <br>
          able to help you get through this problem (homophobia). Another solution is to not let it affect you. Sexuality <br>
          is a weird way to define someone. If you have a problem with some's sexual orientation, think about some of <br>
          their other traits. Love people for the kind of person they are, not the kind of person they love.</p>
        
      <h3>Racism</h3>
        <p>This kind of discrimination is almost always directed to someone of a race that's based on the color of their skin <br>
        or whatever they believe in. Examples of racism: An African-American man was arrested because his wife asked, "Can you not <br>
         arrest him in front of the kids?" <br> </p>
        <p>The officer said to the father, "You're going to jail because your wife keeps running her mouth." The officer did not have <br>
        to fulfill the wife's wishes, but it is obvious that he made the comment he did while arresting her husband because he <br>
        he was insulted by a black woman insulting him, a white man with authority. </p>
        <p>Much like the solutions to some other problems on this site, a possible solution to racism is to acknowledge and become <br>
        okay with the fact that everyone is not like you, and that everyone's differences are what makes life so interesting, <br>
        beautiful, and unique. </p>
       
       <h3>Bullying</h3>
       <p>Bullying is when someone harrassess someone else. This can be mental, physical, social, emotional, and/or cyber bullying. <br>
          To prevent bullying you stop it before it starts. If you experince harrasment on a regular basis, tell a teacher, a parent, <br>
          or guardian. This harrassment could be directed towards you or someone else. Helping yourself or someone else is <br>
           not being a tattle tale. If you see it, report it. It's all about commonuncation. </p> 
       <p>Victims of bullying can show certain signs. Such signs are known as symptoms. This includes unexplained injuries, <br>
          a change in eating habits, or being less sociable than before. Not all victims of bullying show these signs. <br>
          This is when you have to pay attention. If you think someone is a victim of bullying, ask them about it. Sometimes <br>
          it is easier for the victim to be approached by someone who is willing to help rather than appraoching someone on <br>
          their own. Bullies mainly try to humiliate their victims and make them devastated. This can lead to the victim <br>
          feeling responsible for the bullying, and they will begin to believe that the harrassment is their fault, and there <br>
          fore should not talk to anyone about what is going on. Whenever you see a student or peer in danger, make sure you <br>
          take it seriously.</p>
